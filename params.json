  "body": "### Welcome to Alfred.\r\nAlfred is a simple to lose help ticket bot that allows easy communication between support personnel and customers\r\n\r\n### Why Slack?\r\nSlack is a team collaboration platform that brings multiple integrations and applications into one place. So why add a separate application when you can just keep using slack the way you do?\r\n\r\n### Slack + Alfred\r\nAlfred makes a channel for each ticket created. Support personel can respond to the ticket by mentioning the bot's name, @alfred, which will send an email notification to the customer. The customer never has to log in to slack, their communication is done from an external webpage. This allows support personel to discuss the given ticket without including the customer, to allow for easy issue resolution.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nAuthors: @skiracerdude, @robertriachi, @camstu15 and @gabrielallachi",
